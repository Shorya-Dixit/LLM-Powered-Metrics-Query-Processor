## Running the Application

### Step 1: Run All Cells in Order
Run each cell in sequence:
1. Cell 1: Imports and Setup
2. Cell 2: Date Handling Functions
3. Cell 3: Prompt Template
4. Cell 4: Main Processing Function
5. Cell 5: JSON Conversion Function
6. Cell 6: Main Application Class
7. Cell 7: Testing Functions
8. Cell 8: Example Usage and Testing
9. Cell 9: Interactive Query Interface

### Step 2: Start Interactive Interface
After running all cells, the interactive interface will start automatically. You'll see:
```
Welcome to the Metrics Query Processor!
==================================================

Example queries:
1. Get me Flipkart's GMV for the last one year
2. Compare Amazon and Walmart's revenue from last quarter
3. Show me Meta's profit between January 2023 and March 2024

Type 'exit' to quit, 'clear' to clear conversation history
==================================================
```

### Step 3: Using the Interactive Interface

#### Available Commands:
- Type your query and press Enter to process it
- Type 'exit' to quit the application
- Type 'clear' to reset conversation history

#### Example Interaction:
```
Enter your query:
> Get me Flipkart's GMV for last quarter

Processing query...

Result:
[
  {
    "entity": "Flipkart",
    "parameter": "GMV",
    "startDate": "2024-02-02",
    "endDate": "2024-05-02"
  }
]
```

## 3. Important Notes
- Ensure all cells are executed in order
- Wait for each cell to complete before running the next
- Make sure your Groq API key is valid
- Maintain active internet connection
- The interface will remember conversation context for up to 6 messages
- Use 'clear' command if you want to start a fresh conversation

## 4. Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check if all cells were executed in order
2. Verify your API key is correctly set
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Try clearing the conversation history
5. Restart the kernel and run all cells again if needed

## 5. Query Guidelines
For best results:
- Include company name and metric in your query
- Use supported date formats or relative dates
- Keep queries clear and specific
- Use comparison terms like "Compare with" or "Compare to" for multiple companies
